# CarList

## Before that task has begun

Create a fork of this repo and save all your code in this fork.

## Timeframe

This task has a timeframe of 3 hours

## Application

I would like an application that can handle car data so i don't have to have 
them written down on a piece of paper.
I would like the application to be able to the following:

- Create a new list
- View the current list
- Add a car to a list
- Edit a car in a list
- Save data to a file so i can send it via e-mail
- Read data so i can import the saved file

The interface doesn't matter as long as it's fast and easy to navigate.

I would like to be able to save the following car data (the list might expand later)
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Number of tires
- Fuel (petrol/diesel/electric)

The only properties that are required are `Make`, `Model` and `Fuel`.

The application has to be written in C# (dotnet 8), how you make the UI doesn't matter.
